# Camping

Hello, World!  
This is my pygame project called "Camping".  
  
Based on a video game called "On My Own".  
Go check it out!  
  
To run the game:  
 * Download all files in the same directory
 * Install pygame `pip install pygame`
 * Run the `main.py` script

NOTE:
As of now, "normal" version of pygame can't be
installed for python3.11. If you are using python3.11
you'll need to install a "beta" vresion of pygame,
compatible with python3.11.

Use this command: `pip install pygame --pre`.
