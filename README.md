# Camping

Hello, World!  
This is my pygame project called "Camping".  
  
Based on a video game called "On My Own".  
Go check it out!
On My Own Steam page: https://store.steampowered.com/app/351730/On_My_Own/
  
To run the game:
 * Firstly, install python if you haven't done so already (version 3.9 and above should work just fine);
 * Download this source code and open a command prompt in the main directory;
 * Install pygame module for python using this command in the command prompt: `pip install pygame`;
 * Run the `main.py` script using this command in the command prompt: `py main.py`.

NOTE:
As of now, "normal" version of pygame can't be
installed for python3.11. If you are using python3.11
you'll need to install a "beta" vresion of pygame,
compatible with python3.11.

Use this command instead: `pip install pygame --pre`.
